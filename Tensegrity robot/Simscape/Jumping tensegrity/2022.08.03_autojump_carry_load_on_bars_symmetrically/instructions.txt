In this version, take consideration of:

bars carrying (a small) battery,

bars carrying a motor

------> batteries and motors are placed symmetrically

In the next version, take consideration of:

length differences in cables ---- same K D different L

change into a big battery, carried inside the tensegrity robot, along with a onboard CPU (not so good, preferrable carrying loads on each bars, since the shape change can be big during jumping process)
